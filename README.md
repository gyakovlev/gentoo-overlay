This is my personal portage overlay for [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org/).  
I develop and test new ebuilds here and sometimes collect some ebuilds from other overlays.  
This overlay is not meant for public consumption, is unstable and packages can go away anytime.  
All credits for "stolen" ebuilds go to their respective authors.
